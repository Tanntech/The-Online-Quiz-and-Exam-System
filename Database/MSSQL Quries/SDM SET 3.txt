(31, 'How do you add code changes to the staging area in Git?', 'By using the git stage command', 'By using the git commit command', 'By using the git add command', 'By using the git push command', 'C', 'git add moves selected changes into the staging area for review and commit.'),
(31, 'What happens when you add code changes to the staging area in Git?', 'The changes are permanently saved in the repository.', 'The changes are only saved locally and not shared with others.', 'The changes are organized and ready for review before committing.', 'The changes are automatically pushed to the remote repository.', 'C', 'Staged changes are prepared and reviewed before they are permanently committed.'),

(31, 'After adding code changes to the staging area, what is the next step in the Git workflow?', 'Pushing the changes to the remote repository', 'Committing the changes to the local repository', 'Discarding the changes', 'Reviewing the changes with team members', 'B', 'After staging, changes must be committed to save them permanently in the repository history.'),
(31, 'What is the purpose of committing code changes in Git?', 'To share the changes with other team members.', 'To permanently save the changes in the repository''s history.', 'To push the changes to the remote repository.', 'To review the changes with team members.', 'B', 'Committing stores a snapshot of the changes permanently in Git’s history.'),

(31, 'Why would you create a new branch in Git?', 'To permanently save the changes in the repository''s history.', 'To share the changes with other team members.', 'To experiment with new features or bug fixes without affecting the main development line.', 'To replace the need for version control systems.', 'C', 'Branches provide a safe environment to develop features or fixes independently.'),
(31, 'What is the purpose of merging branches in Git?', 'To permanently save the changes in the repository''s history.', 'To discard any changes made in the branches.', 'To combine the changes from one branch into another.', 'To push the changes to the remote repository.', 'C', 'Merging integrates changes from one branch into another, usually into the main branch.'),
(31, 'How does Git handle conflicts during branch merging?', 'Git automatically resolves conflicts without any manual intervention.', 'Git discards all conflicting changes.', 'Git prompts the developer to resolve conflicts manually.', 'Git creates a new branch for each conflict.', 'C', 'When a conflict occurs during merging, Git highlights the conflicting sections and asks the developer to manually resolve them.'),
(31, 'When is it appropriate to merge a branch into the main development line?', 'After experimenting with new features or bug fixes in the branch.', 'After adding code changes to the staging area.', 'After committing code changes to the local repository.', 'After creating a new branch.', 'A', 'Branches should be merged into the main line only after the new features or bug fixes are tested and finalized.');
