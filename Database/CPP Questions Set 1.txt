1. What will happen if you try to use the this pointer in a static member
function?
A) It will compile successfully.
B) It will result in a compilation error.
C) The code will run with undefined behavior.
D) The static member function will automatically receive the this pointer

Correct Answer: B) It will result in a compilation error.
Explanation:
Static member functions do not belong to any specific object, so they do not receive the this pointer.



2. Which of the following C++ features provides the ability to use the same
function name with different arguments?
A) Inheritance
B) Encapsulation
C) Polymorphism
D) Abstraction

Correct Answer: C) Polymorphism
Explanation:
Function overloading (compile-time polymorphism) allows the same function name with different parameters.


3. What is the purpose of static variables in a function in C++?
A) They retain their values across multiple calls to the function.
B) They only exist during the execution of the function.
C) They cannot be initialized within the function.
D) They are used for memory allocation.

Correct Answer: A) They retain their values across multiple calls to the function.
Explanation:
Static variables are initialized only once and preserve their value between function calls.

4. If a class has no constructor, which of the following will happen?
A) The class will throw an error during object creation.
B) A default constructor will be automatically provided.
C) A default constructor will not be created automatically, and the object cannot be
created.
D) The class will not be able to access member variables.

Correct Answer: B) A default constructor will be automatically provided.
Explanation:
C++ provides an implicit default constructor if none is defined.


5. Which of the following is not a valid declaration for a constant member
function?
A) int getData() const;
B) void display() const { cout << "Display"; }
C) void setData(int x) const { data = x; }
D) void modify() const;

members when they have the same name.
B) The this pointer refers to the address of the current object.
C) The this pointer is available only in non-static member functions.
D) The this pointer is passed explicitly to each member function by the
compiler

Correct Answer: D) The this pointer is passed explicitly to each member function by the compiler
Explanation:
The this pointer is passed implicitly, not explicitly.

A) A destructor is automatically called when an object goes out of scope.
B) A destructor cannot take arguments.
C) A destructor can be overloaded.

A) Declaring multiple constructors in a class
B) Declaring a function inside a class
C) Declaring a function outside a class
D) Declaring a variable of type function

Correct Answer: D)Declaring a variable of type function
Explanation:
Functions cannot be variables (only pointers or references to functions).


9. Which of the following is the correct declaration for a constant pointer to
an integer in C++?
A) int* const ptr;
B) const int* ptr;
C) int const* ptr;
D) const ptr int*;

Const member functions cannot modify data; const objects cannot call non-const functions.
 
17. What will be the output of the following code?
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        cout << "Constructor Called" << endl;
    }
    ~MyClass() {
        cout << "Destructor Called" << endl;
    }
};
int main() {
    MyClass obj;
}

A) Constructor Called Destructor Called

18. What will happen if you try to use the this pointer in a static member
function?
A) It will compile successfully.
B) It will result in a compilation error.
C) The code will run with undefined behavior.
D) The static member function will automatically receive the this pointer

Correct Answer: B) it will result in a compilation error
explanation:
Static member functions do not belong to any specific object, so they do not have access to the this pointer. Using this inside a static function causes a compile-time error.

A) Deriving new classes from existing classes
B) Overloading of classes
C) Classes with same names
D) Wrapping of data into a single class

25.What will be the output of the following C++ program?
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int a = 5;
	auto check = [=]() 
        {
		a = 10;
	};

	return 0;
}
A) Segmentation fault
B) Value of a: 5
C) Value of a: 10
D) Error

Correct Answer: D) error
Explanation:
The variable a is captured by value in the lambda ([=]), so it is read-only inside the lambda. Attempting to modify it causes a compilation error.

    }
A) This sentence
B) This sentence is redirected
C) This sentence is redirected to a file
D) This sentence to a file

Correct Answer: C) this sentence is redirected to a file
Explanation:
The freopen function redirects standard output to a file, so the output is written into myfile.txt.


31.By using which function does the buffer are automatically flushed?
A) fopen
B) copy
C) compare
D) fclose

Correct Answer: D) fclose
Explanation: fclose() is used to close the file and flush it out of memory for safe closing of files opened during the execution of program. In short to avoid memory faults during the execution of the program.

B) References can be re-assigned to refer to different variables after initialization.
C) References occupy additional memory space compared to pointers.
D) References are used for dynamic memory allocation.

Correct Answer: A) References cannot be null.

B) Namespaces prevent variable names from being used multiple times in a program.
C) Namespaces avoid naming conflicts by encapsulating code into a named scope.
D) Namespaces restrict access to functions within a program.

Correct Answer: C) Namespaces avoid naming conflicts by encapsulating code into a named scope.
Explanation: Namespaces in C++ encapsulate code into named scopes, preventing naming conflicts by providing a way to group related code elements.

A) To deallocate memory dynamically.
B) To allocate memory for an object or variable dynamically.
C) To initialize a variable with a default value.
D) To declare a constant variable.

Correct Answer: B) To allocate memory for an object or variable dynamically.
Explanation: The ‘new’ operator in C++ is used for dynamic memory allocation, allowing the allocation of memory for objects or variables during runtime.

38. What does the ‘this’ pointer refer to in C++?
A) It points to the previous object in a linked list.
B) It points to the current object itself.
C) It points to the base class object in an inheritance hierarchy.
D) It points to a static member of a class.

Correct Answer: B) It points to the current object itself.
Explanation: The ‘this’ pointer in C++ is a pointer that holds the address of the current object when a member function is called.

39.What is the purpose of the ‘delete’ operator in C++?
A) To remove elements from a container.
B) To deallocate memory for an object or array allocated with ‘new’.
C) To remove a function from a class.
